## Title: Generate QR code for Dev Tunnel URLs when port forwarding starts
### Problem
Accessing a Dev Tunnel from another device requires copying the public URL and transferring it (clipboard sync, messaging, email). That manual handoff is repeated, slow, and interrupts developer workflows that involve mobile or external-device testing (mobile web, OAuth callbacks, live demos, device testing). This is a handoff/UX problem — the URL is already exposed by VS Code, there is no need to change networking or permissions.

### Proposed feature

Add an explicit, user-initiated way to generate and display a QR code for a Dev Tunnel / forwarded port URL.
__Minimal UX surface (examples, not prescriptive):__
- A small QR icon next to a forwarded port / tunnel URL in the Port Forwarding / Dev Tunnels UI.
- A command: Dev Tunnels: Show QR Code (works for the selected forwarded URL).
- A context menu item on a forwarded port entry.

__Clicking the icon/command opens a small modal/panel showing:__
- A generated QR code for the resolved public URL
- The raw URL (copyable)
- A dismiss action

__Important constraints:__
- Explicit user action only — no automatic popups or forced rendering.
- No persistent UI clutter — unobtrusive icon + transient panel.
- No new network behavior or permissions — this is a presentation of already-exposed data.
- No telemetry and no heavy dependencies; prefer a tiny QR generator library or in-tree implementation.

__Why this belongs in core__
- Dev Tunnels / port forwarding are first-party, security-sensitive features. The resolved public URL is already displayed by VS Code; QR generation is purely a local presentation choice.
- Extensions do not reliably have access to Dev Tunnel lifecycle events or the resolved public URL in a way that would provide the same UX integration (icon in the port UI, guaranteed lifecycle sync).
- Implementing this as an extension would either require new APIs that expose tunnel lifecycle/URLs or lead to a degraded UX (manual paste into extension UI). If the team prefers an extension approach, adding the necessary extension APIs is the minimum required work.
