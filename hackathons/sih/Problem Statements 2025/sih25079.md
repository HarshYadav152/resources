# MetroMind: AI-Powered Document Intelligence for KMRL

## Hackathon Pitch

### The Problem
Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) is drowning in documents—thousands of pages daily across multiple formats, languages, and departments. This information overload has created critical bottlenecks: delayed decisions, siloed knowledge, compliance risks, and duplicated efforts. As KMRL expands its operations, this documentary burden threatens to undermine efficiency, safety, and service reliability.

### Our Solution
**MetroMind** is a comprehensive document intelligence platform designed specifically for transit operations:

1. **Universal Document Processing**: Ingests and normalizes documents from all sources and formats
2. **Dual-Language Comprehension**: Processes both English and Malayalam content with equal proficiency
3. **Role-Based Intelligence Delivery**: Pushes critical insights to the right stakeholders automatically
4. **Knowledge Graph Architecture**: Connects related information across departmental boundaries
5. **Traceable Summarization**: Condenses lengthy documents while maintaining links to source materials

### Technical Stack
- **Document Processing**: Azure Document Intelligence with custom ML models for transit documents
- **Language Models**: Specialized LLMs fine-tuned on KMRL operational content and terminology
- **Knowledge Graph**: Neo4j for entity relationship mapping across documents
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch with domain-specific indexing
- **Frontend**: React dashboard with role-based views and mobile responsiveness
- **Integration Layer**: APIs for Maximo, SharePoint, and future IoT/UNS systems

### Demo Highlights
- **Unified Inbox**: Watch MetroMind process a diverse set of incoming documents in real-time
- **Smart Summarization**: See how a 50-page safety regulation becomes a targeted action brief
- **Cross-Department Connections**: Experience how related information is linked across silos
- **Role-Based Insights**: View customized dashboards for Engineers, Finance, and Operations
- **Bilingual Processing**: Demonstrate seamless handling of Malayalam maintenance reports

### Implementation Plan (for 36-hour hackathon)
1. **Hours 1-8**: Document ingestion pipeline and format normalization
2. **Hours 9-16**: NLP engine development for summarization and entity extraction
3. **Hours 17-24**: Knowledge graph implementation and relationship mapping
4. **Hours 25-32**: Role-based dashboard and notification system
5. **Hours 33-36**: Integration testing, performance optimization, and presentation

### Unique Value Proposition
Unlike generic document management systems, MetroMind:
- Understands transit-specific terminology and operational contexts
- Processes both English and Malayalam with equal effectiveness
- Proactively identifies cross-departmental dependencies
- Delivers insights based on job function and current responsibilities
- Creates an evolving organizational memory that grows smarter over time

### Post-Hackathon Roadmap
1. Integration with KMRL's existing Maximo and SharePoint systems
2. Mobile app development for field staff access
3. Implementation of compliance tracking and deadline alerts
4. Knowledge retention module for capturing insights from retiring staff
5. Expansion to include real-time IoT and UNS data streams

MetroMind transforms KMRL's documentary burden into a strategic asset—cutting through information overload to deliver the right insights to the right people at the right time, ultimately supporting safer, more efficient metro operations for the citizens of Kochi.
