# SARAL: Smart Attendance Recognition and Logging System

## Hackathon Pitch

### The Problem
Rural Indian schools face a critical administrative burden: manual attendance systems consume valuable teaching time, create error-prone records, and complicate government reporting for crucial programs like mid-day meals. With limited resources and connectivity, traditional high-tech solutions remain inaccessible.

### Our Solution
**SARAL** is a lightweight, offline-capable attendance system designed specifically for resource-constrained rural schools:

1. **Hybrid Recognition Technology**: Combines QR code badges with optional facial recognition that works even on basic smartphones
2. **Offline-First Architecture**: Functions without continuous internet connectivity
3. **Ultra-Low Resource Requirements**: Operates on entry-level Android devices or repurposed older phones
4. **Automated Reporting**: Generates government-compliant reports for schemes like mid-day meals

### Technical Stack
- Flutter for cross-platform mobile development
- TensorFlow Lite for optimized facial recognition
- SQLite for local data storage
- Firebase for occasional cloud synchronization
- QR code generation/scanning libraries

### Demo Highlights
- **One-Touch Attendance**: Teacher scans classroom using smartphone camera, system identifies present students in seconds
- **Backup Methods**: QR badges for students when facial recognition is challenging
- **Simplified Dashboard**: Clean interface designed for teachers with varying tech proficiency
- **Automated Reports**: One-click generation of attendance summaries for government submissions
- **Low-Light Performance**: Optimized algorithms for varying classroom conditions

### Implementation Plan (for 36-hour hackathon)
1. **Hours 1-8**: Core attendance capture system and database architecture
2. **Hours 9-16**: Offline-first functionality and QR code implementation
3. **Hours 17-24**: Optimized facial recognition module and UI development
4. **Hours 25-32**: Reporting tools and data synchronization
5. **Hours 33-36**: Testing, optimization, and presentation preparation

### Unique Value Proposition
Unlike existing attendance systems, SARAL:
- Works reliably in low-connectivity environments
- Requires minimal hardware investment (uses existing or basic smartphones)
- Offers multiple attendance-taking methods for flexibility
- Generates government-compliant reports automatically
- Features an interface designed specifically for rural teachers

### Post-Hackathon Roadmap
1. Pilot in 10 rural schools across different states
2. Develop administration portal for education departments
3. Create student tracking analytics for dropout prevention
4. Build open API for integration with other education systems

By reclaiming instructional time, ensuring accurate resource allocation, and simplifying administrative tasks, SARAL transforms a daily burden into a 10-second taskâ€”allowing rural schools to focus on what matters most: teaching.
