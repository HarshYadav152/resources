# KrishiSakhav: AI-Powered Farmer Advisory System

## Hackathon Pitch

### The Problem
Kerala's 1.5 million farmers face a critical knowledge gap: when agricultural challenges arise, expert advice is rarely available at the moment of need. Government extension services are overwhelmed, with each Krishibhavan officer supporting thousands of farmers across diverse crops and conditions. Without timely guidance, farmers make suboptimal decisions affecting yields, incomes, and sustainability.

### Our Solution
**KrishiSakhav** is a comprehensive AI-based advisory system designed specifically for Malayalam-speaking farmers:

1. **Conversational Voice Interface**: Natural Malayalam language processing for voice queries
2. **Multimodal Analysis Engine**: Combines image recognition with contextual farming knowledge
3. **Hyperlocal Intelligence**: Tailors advice to specific regions, crops, and seasonal conditions
4. **Human-in-the-Loop Architecture**: Seamless escalation to agricultural officers for complex queries

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Progressive Web App with React.js optimized for low-bandwidth areas
- **Voice Processing**: Custom ASR tuned for Malayalam rural dialects and agricultural terminology
- **AI Engine**: Fine-tuned LLM on Kerala-specific agricultural data with RAG implementation
- **Image Analysis**: TensorFlow model trained on local crop diseases and pest patterns
- **Knowledge Base**: Structured repository of Kerala agricultural practices, schemes, and research
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI with Redis caching for responsive performance

### Demo Highlights
- **Voice Query Flow**: Watch a farmer ask about banana leaf spot treatment in Malayalam
- **Disease Recognition**: See real-time identification of crop diseases from uploaded photos
- **Contextual Response**: Experience how the system incorporates location, season, and weather
- **Expert Handoff**: Witness the seamless escalation process to Krishibhavan officers
- **Farmer Dashboard**: View personalized recommendations and historical query tracking

### Implementation Plan (for 36-hour hackathon)
1. **Hours 1-8**: Core NLP engine and Malayalam voice processing implementation
2. **Hours 9-16**: Knowledge base structuring and integration with LLM
3. **Hours 17-24**: Image recognition model development and multimodal fusion
4. **Hours 25-32**: Frontend development and offline capabilities
5. **Hours 33-36**: Testing with real farmer queries, optimization, and presentation

### Unique Value Proposition
Unlike existing agricultural apps, KrishiSakhav:
- Specializes in Malayalam language processing for authentic farmer interactions
- Functions in low-connectivity rural environments with minimal data usage
- Adapts advice to Kerala's specific microclimates and farming practices
- Creates a learning ecosystem that improves with each farmer interaction
- Supplements rather than replaces human extension services

### Post-Hackathon Roadmap
1. Pilot with 3 Krishibhavans in different agroclimatic zones
2. Expand knowledge base with traditional farming practices
3. Develop integration with weather services and market price data
4. Create farmer community features for peer-to-peer knowledge sharing
5. Build agricultural officer dashboard for trend monitoring

KrishiSakhav transforms how agricultural knowledge flows to farmersâ€”from sporadic, generalized advice to instant, personalized guidance available 24/7 in their own language and context.
