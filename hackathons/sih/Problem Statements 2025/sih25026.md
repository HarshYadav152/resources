# AYUSH Bridge: Terminology Microservice for NAMASTE and ICD-11 TM2 Integration

## Hackathon Pitch

### The Problem
India's AYUSH healthcare systems are digitizing, but face a critical integration challenge: how to make traditional medicine records interoperable with global healthcare systems while preserving their unique diagnostic frameworks. Current EMRs lack standardized bridges between NAMASTE codes and WHO's ICD-11 TM2 module, creating silos that prevent analytics, insurance processing, and research collaboration.

### Our Solution
**AYUSH Bridge** is a FHIR R4-compliant terminology microservice that seamlessly connects NAMASTE, WHO International Terminologies for Ayurveda, and ICD-11 (both TM2 and Biomedicine modules) within any EMR system:

1. **Dual-Coding Engine**: Maps traditional diagnoses to global standards while preserving semantic integrity
2. **Intelligent Autocomplete API**: Context-aware diagnosis search across multiple terminology systems
3. **FHIR-Native Architecture**: Fully compliant with India's 2016 EHR Standards
4. **OAuth 2.0/ABHA Security**: Enterprise-grade authentication with comprehensive audit trails

### Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with HAPI FHIR server implementation
- **Database**: MongoDB with specialized terminology indexing
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints with GraphQL option for complex queries
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0 with ABHA integration and JWT tokens
- **Containerization**: Docker for easy deployment in any healthcare environment

### Demo Highlights
- **Terminology Management Console**: Real-time CSV ingestion and WHO API synchronization
- **Interactive Mapping Explorer**: Visual interface showing relationships between code systems
- **FHIR Resource Generator**: Automatic conversion of diagnoses into standard ProblemList entries
- **Compliance Dashboard**: Verification of adherence to EHR Standards and ICD-11 coding rules

### Implementation Plan (for 36-hour hackathon)
1. **Hours 1-8**: Core FHIR server setup and data model design
2. **Hours 9-16**: NAMASTE CodeSystem implementation and WHO API integration
3. **Hours 17-24**: ConceptMap development and translation operations
4. **Hours 25-32**: Security implementation and REST endpoint completion
5. **Hours 33-36**: Testing, documentation, and presentation preparation

### Unique Value Proposition
Unlike existing terminology services, AYUSH Bridge:
- Specifically addresses the AYUSH-to-global medicine translation gap
- Supports dual-coding workflows required for traditional medicine practice
- Maintains semantic integrity of traditional diagnostic concepts
- Provides audit-ready metadata for regulatory compliance
- Enables real-time analytics for the Ministry of AYUSH

### Post-Hackathon Roadmap
1. Expand support for Siddha and Unani terminology systems
2. Develop EMR vendor integration plugins (starting with popular AYUSH systems)
3. Create advanced analytics module for AYUSH morbidity reporting
4. Build machine learning-enhanced mapping suggestions for complex diagnoses

AYUSH Bridge transforms a critical interoperability challenge into an opportunity for AYUSH systems to preserve their rich diagnostic heritage while participating fully in the global digital health ecosystem.
